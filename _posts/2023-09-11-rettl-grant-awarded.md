Pleased to announce that our grant proposal to NSF's RETTL program, *An AI Tutoring System for Pollinator Conservation Community Science Training*, has been awarded, for $849,890!

This project is led by my colleague Dr. Sarath Sreedharan and includes Dr. Nate Blanchard of CSU's Vision Lab and Dr. Jill Zarestky in the CSU School of Education.  In this project we will develop AI-powered tools for citizen science, focusing on identification of different pollinator species.  Let's get them bees!
