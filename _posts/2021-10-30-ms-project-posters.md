Congratulations to M.S. students Shivani Mogullapalli, Shriram Gaddam, and Mohit Kumar Katragadda who presented their M.S. Project posters at the CSU CS Graduate Research Symposium yesterday!

CSU Computer Science has a non-thesis research initiation option for master's students wherein the student must conduct a research project under the guidance of a faculty member and present a poster on their project in their last semester.  Very proud of the work these three have done this semester and I can wait to see them wrap up the work and graduate!

Mohit's project: **Distributed Training of 3D Object Recognition Using Point Clouds**

Shivani's project: **Mapping Between Face Recogniton Feature Vector from Various CNN Models**

Shriram's project: **Exploring Embedding Spaces in Transformers by Mapping Feature Vectors**
