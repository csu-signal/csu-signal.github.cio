Congratulations to Dr. **Nada Alalyani** for successfully defending her Ph.D. dissertation!

In Nada's dissertation, *Embodied Multimodal Referring Expressions Generation*, she takes the Diana system which I worked on through my postdoc and uses it to train an LLM that can drive interactive virtual avatar behavior to refer to objects in context using mixed modalities. It's also somewhat bittersweet for me because this represents probably the last research done with the Diana system from the CwC project.

Congratulations to Nada!  Iâ€™ve been continually impressed by your ability to take challenging ideas and turn them into reality. Best of luck in your future endeavors!
