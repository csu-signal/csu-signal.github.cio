Here are three of us outside the Lingotto Conference Center in Turin, Italy, site of LREC-COLING 2024, held from May 20-25. From left to right: Shadi Manafi, Nikhil Krishnaswamy, Abhijnan Nath, and Ibrahim Khebour.

We had one poster presentation and two talks, and LREC-COLING hired a (really quite good, though very loud) Queen cover band for the gala dinner.
