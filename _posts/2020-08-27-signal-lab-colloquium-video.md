Traditionally, computer science faculty at CSU give rapid-fire research presentations at the beginning of the fall semester to present themselves to students and discuss research opportunities.  Due to the Covid situation pushing everything online, the seminar format is being flipped this year, with prerecorded videos being offered followed by Q+A during the scheduled session time.  I took the opportunity to create a 5-minute video overview of some of the SIGNAL Lab's major research thrusts, complete with some video demonstrations.
