SIGNAL Lab Ph.D. student Sadaf Ghaffari presented *Detecting and Accommodating Novel Types and Concepts in an Embodied Simulation Environment* at the Annual Conference on Advances in Cognitive Systems at George Mason University in Arlington, VA.  In this paper, we explore techniques to imbue neural networks with the capability to expand to accommodate new concepts and to detect when the neural model itself is inadequate to the environment, relying on information extracted from an embodied simulation.
