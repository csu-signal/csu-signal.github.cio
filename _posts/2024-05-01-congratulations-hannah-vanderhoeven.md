Congratulations to **Hannah VanderHoeven** on successfully defending her Master's thesis!

Hannah's thesis is entitled *Robust Gesture Detection for Multimodal Problem Solving*, and comprises a synthesis of a few papers that appeared (or will appear) at HCII over the these couple years [[1](https://www.nikhilkrishnaswamy.com/assets/docs/pdfs/HCII-2023-VanderHoeven.pdf), [2](https://www.nikhilkrishnaswamy.com/assets/docs/pdfs/HCII-2024-VanderHoeven-Point.pdf), [3](https://www.nikhilkrishnaswamy.com/assets/docs/pdfs/HCII-2024-VanderHoeven-Multimodal.pdf)], focusing on gesture detection techniques for use in collaborative agents for multimodal problem solving. This work originated in the iSAT project, which we recently completed a demo of to the NSF, and is being expanded for use in the FACT program. 

Congratulations to Hannah!  It's been a pleasure working with you and I'm excited to see where this work goes next!

I don't have a picture of the defense, but here's a picture from the poster session from the NSF iSAT site visit yesterday where similar work was presented. From left to right: Yifan Zhu (Brandeis University), Hannah, and SIGNAL Lab Ph.D. students Mariah Bradford and Ibrahim Khebour.
