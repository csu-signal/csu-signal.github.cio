SIGNAL Lab Ph.D. student Nada Alalyani and I have a new publication that will be appearing at the [Bridging HCI and NLP](https://sites.google.com/view/hciandnlp/home?authuser=0) workshop at the EACL conference in April!  *Embodied Multimodal Agents to Bridge the Understanding Gap* argues that embodied multimodal agents such as virtual avatars and robots play an important role in moving natural language processing toward "deep understanding," and a demonstrable retrieval of communicative intent from an utterance, a la the definition propounded by Emily Bender and Alexander Koller in their "[Climbing towards NLU](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.463.pdf)" paper from last year's ACL.  We discuss the role of multimodal conversational systems in computationally modeling contextually-grounded communication, and discuss ongoing experiments in multimodal referring expression interpretation and generation as an illustrative use case, using CSU/Brandeis/UF's very own [Diana](http://www.embodiedhci.net) agent.

The HCI+NLP workshop will be held in conjunction with the EACL conference, April 20th.  The conference will be held virtually (may we banish COVID and return to in-person events soon!).  Before the proceedings are released, the paper can be viewed [here](https://www.nikhilkrishnaswamy.com/assets/docs/pdfs/HCI+NLP-2021.pdf) on my personal website, and will be appearing on arXiv soon.
