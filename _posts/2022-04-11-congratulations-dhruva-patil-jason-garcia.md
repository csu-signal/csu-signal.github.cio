Congratulations to Dr. **Dhruva Patil** for defending his Ph.D. dissertation and to **Jason Garcia** for defending his Master's thesis!

Dhruva's dissertation is entitled *Something Is Fishy! How ambiguous language affects generalization of video action recognition networks*. In this research, he analyses weaknesses in the label set of the popular Something-Something video action recognition dataset, and discusses how the one-hot encoding of class labels in computer vision tasks may effectively be hamstringing deep neural networks in vision tasks.  Dhruva will be starting a research position at Amazon in June.

Jason's thesis is entitled *Applications of Topological Data Analysis to Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision*. Jason applies techniques of topological data analysis, a mathematical technique for exploring the "shape" of data, to problems in NLP and computer vision, including a novel analysis of the topological properties of the encoder layers in BERT.  Jason will be continuing at CSU for a Ph.D. in Math.

Congratulations to Dhruva and Jason!  It's been a pleasure to work with you and to see you acheive your degrees!
