At the end of the semester, time to take stock of lab activity:

Hannah VanderHoeven's paper *Robust Motion Recognition using Gesture Phase Annotation* was accepted for publication at HCII 2023 in Copenhagen, Denmark in July!

Also at HCII will be *Intentional Microgesture Recognition for Extended Human-Computer Interaction*, with Sheikh Mannan and Hannah as contributing authors!

Mariah Bradford and Ibrahim Khebour's paper *Automatic Detection of Collaborative States in Small Groups Using Multimodal Features* was accepted for publication at AIEd 2023 in Tokyo, Japan, also in July!

Mariah and Ibrahim also contributed to *How Good is Automatic Segmentation as a Multimodal Discourse Annotation Aid?*, accepted for presentation at the Interoperable Semantic Annotation workshop at IWCS in June.

Sadaf Ghaffari's paper *Grounding and Distinguishing Conceptual Vocabulary Through Similarity Learning in Embodied Simulations* was accepted for publication at the IWCS 2023 main conference in Nancy, France!

And finally, Abhijnan Nath and Mannan's paper *AxomiyaBERTa: A Phonologically-aware Transformer Model for Assamese* was accepted for publication in Findings of ACL 2023, the companion volume to the ACL 2023 conference!  Abhijnan was also second author on *2\*n is better than n^2: Decomposing Event Coreference Resolution into Two Tractable Problems*, a collaboration with members of the BoulderNLP group, also accepted to Finding of ACL 2023.  ACL 2023 will be held in Toronto, ON, Canada, in July.

Look out for these papers, and more to come soon.
